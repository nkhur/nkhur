### Hi!

I’m [Navya](https://navyakhurana.vercel.app), a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland. I'm passionate about building tools that leverage machine learning and software to create meaningful, real-world impact. 
I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and design on the side, with a focus on experiences that make tech feel alive.

Outside of work, I’m a curator of niche playlists and a dedicated F1 fan.
